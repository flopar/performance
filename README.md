# Performance
This repository contains the source code of a library that can manipulate a given process's attributes in order to increase its overall performance in comparison with the rest of the system's running programs. 

# Background
This started as a small project while I was doing my internship as a student. The team I was assigned to came up with the idea of trying to create a small testbench for their own program, which later could be used by their customers on their own computers in order see how well the product would perform on their machines and (if needed) manipulate the product's default attributes to increase the overall performance of their application

# Documentation
See subdirectory "docs". It contains a pdf file which started as my bachelor thesis and in time will contain detailed explanations of each new added chapter
